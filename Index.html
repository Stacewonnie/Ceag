    <h1>When I see you</h1>
    <p>06.09.2023...That was the day I realized I like you. 
    The day I dreamed of you...I kmow this was a sign. And that's how it all began! But everyone knows that old saying...
    "Soulmates are destined to meet...but not destined to be togheter...", and ungortunately for an unknown reason this applies to us.
    But don't worry, I've told myself this many times, we will never be togheter.</p>
    <p>I feel bad that it's so difficult, I wish I could control my feelings...because it's so bad to like you.
    And I would rather, in every possible way, keep my love a secret than lose your friendship. Or it would even be easier if we had the same feeling
    Our side conversations, our exchanges of messages, silly smiles at jokes told, </p>
