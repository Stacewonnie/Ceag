    <h1>When I see you</h1>
    <p>06.09.2023...That was the day I realized I like you. 
    The day I dreamed of you...I kmow this was a sign. And that's how it all began! But everyone knows that old saying...
    "Soulmates are destined to meet...but not destined to be togheter...", and ungortunately for an unknown reason this applies to us.
    But don't worry, I've told myself this many times, we will never be togheter.</p>
    <p>I feel bad that it's so difficult, I wish I could control my feelings...because it's so bad to like you.
    And I would rather, in every possible way, keep my love a secret than lose your friendship. Or it would even be easier if we had the same feeling
    Our side conversations, our exchanges of messages, silly smiles at jokes told... </p>
    <p> And realized that...you weren't busy all the time, I just wasn't your priority...We met in another Life...because in this one, only I Love...
    I chose to give up on you because it was tearing me apart. And every time.." relax, I don't even care lol " that's what I sad after spending the whole morning crying.</p>
    <p>I really like you, but I need you to leave..Because liking you is killing me.</p>
    <p>I wanted to rewrite our friendship, and delete the part where I fell in love with you.</p>
    <p>I really wanted us to work out.</p>
